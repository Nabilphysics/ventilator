# RobotController

This is a project I've done for the purpose of controlloing any kind of electronics devices using android app. 
I've done it for the purpose of university project.

Note that this app is tested for the android version 4.2 and below. Above these versions connecting with bluetooth is different. As I didn't get enough time for that I didn't go for those versions.
